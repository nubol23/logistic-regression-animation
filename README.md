# Logistic Regression Simple Animation

In this repo there are two simple animations of Logistic Regression animation in 2D and 3D.

It is built using OpenGL for the graphics and scikit-learn to generate the dataset.

The rotation with the mouse is not the best way to implement it and could be improved, any help with that would be very apreciated.

## Requierements
* pyopengl
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib

## Run
To run the code just type:
`python 2d_lr.py` or `python 3d_lr.py`
